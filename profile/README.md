## INTRODUCTION
People+AI is a community of doers, dreamers, tinkerers & innovators who believe in the power of ai for the people. Powered by the folks behind most of Indiaâ€™s DPI efforts, the team behind People+AI has a proven track record of building technology in the service of humanity. 

People+AI is trying to create a future by DESIGN. We want to evolve technology in service of humanity and not the other way round. We believe that ai will allow  fundamental paradigm shifts to take place in India:
- [ ] Voice first: India will be voice-first
- [ ] Listen at scale: Governance will go from top-down to bottom-up
- [ ] +ai talent: Nurture talent for a +AI World which involves reskilling, new-skills, new jobs and talent communities unlocked.
